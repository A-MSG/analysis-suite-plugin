Static Analysis Suite
=====================

This module provides the coding guidelines and IntelliJ IDEA configuration for  all static code analysis plugins. 
Moreover, this module provides an aggregator POM for maven so you can build all the static code analysis plugins
with one call. There are also some small scripts provided that simplify the build process.

See also [the contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are planning to write a pull request.
 
All plug-ins are maintained by Ullrich Hafner. For more details please refer to the wiki
